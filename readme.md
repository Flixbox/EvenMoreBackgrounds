# Even More Backgrounds

Adds a lot of backgrounds for the main menu to the game. Most are from Unsplash or Pixabay, credits are usually in the appropriate folder.

Make sure you check the "Allow animated backgrounds" option in the settings for Vanilla Backgrounds Expanded if you want the animated videos to be shown.
